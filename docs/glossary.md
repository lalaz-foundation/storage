# Glossary

Terminology and definitions for the Lalaz Storage package.

## A

### Adapter
A class that implements the `StorageInterface` to provide storage operations for a specific backend. Examples include `LocalStorageAdapter` and `MemoryStorageAdapter`.

### Append
A file operation that adds content to the end of an existing file without overwriting it.

## B

### Bootstrap
The initial setup file (`tests/bootstrap.php`) that configures autoloading and environment for tests.

## C

### Configuration
An array of settings that defines how storage disks are set up, including driver type, paths, and URLs.

```php
$config = [
    'default' => 'local',
    'disks' => [
        'local' => [
            'driver' => 'local',
            'path' => '/storage',
        ],
    ],
];
```

### Contract
See [Interface](#interface).

## D

### Default Disk
The storage disk used when no specific disk is requested. Set via the `'default'` configuration key.

### Directory Operations
Operations related to creating, listing, and deleting directories in storage.

### Disk
A named storage configuration that maps to a specific driver and its settings. Applications can have multiple disks for different purposes.

### Driver
The underlying storage mechanism (e.g., 'local', 'memory'). Each driver corresponds to an adapter class.

## E

### Exception
An error thrown when storage operations fail. All storage errors throw `StorageException`.

### Extend
The method used to register custom storage drivers with the `StorageManager`.

```php
$manager->extend('s3', function ($config) {
    return new S3Adapter($config);
});
```

## F

### Facade
The `Storage` class that provides static access to storage operations. Acts as a convenient wrapper around `StorageManager`.

### Factory Method
A method that creates and returns an object instance. The `StorageManager` uses factory methods to create driver instances.

## G

### Get
The operation to read and return file contents.

## I

### Integration Test
A test that verifies multiple components work together correctly. Storage integration tests verify end-to-end file operations.

### Interface
The `StorageInterface` defines the contract that all storage adapters must implement. Ensures consistent behavior across drivers.

## L

### Local Storage
File storage on the local filesystem using `LocalStorageAdapter`.

### Last Modified
The timestamp of when a file was last changed, returned by `lastModified()`.

## M

### Manager
See [StorageManager](#storagemanager).

### Memory Storage
In-memory file storage using `MemoryStorageAdapter`. Ideal for testing.

### MIME Type
The content type identifier for a file (e.g., 'text/plain', 'application/pdf'). Determined by file extension or content.

### Move
A file operation that relocates a file from one path to another, removing it from the original location.

## N

### Namespace
The PHP namespace for storage classes: `Lalaz\Storage`.

## P

### Path
The location of a file relative to the storage root. Example: `'uploads/documents/file.pdf'`.

### Path Traversal
A security attack attempting to access files outside the storage root using sequences like `../`. Blocked by `LocalStorageAdapter`.

### Prepend
A file operation that adds content to the beginning of an existing file.

### Public URL
The web-accessible URL for a stored file, generated by `getPublicUrl()`.

### Purge
The operation to clear all cached driver instances from the `StorageManager`.

### Put
The operation to write content to a file, creating it if it doesn't exist.

## R

### Recursive
An option for directory operations that includes nested subdirectories. Used with `files()`, `directories()`, and `deleteDirectory()`.

### Root
The base directory for a storage disk, configured via the `'path'` option.

## S

### Service Provider
The `StorageServiceProvider` class that registers storage services with the framework container.

### Static Facade
See [Facade](#facade).

### Storage
The main facade class (`Lalaz\Storage\Storage`) providing static access to storage operations.

### StorageException
The exception class for all storage-related errors. Includes factory methods for specific error types.

### StorageInterface
The contract interface that all storage adapters implement. Defines 20+ methods for file operations.

### StorageManager
The central class that manages disk configuration, driver creation, and caching. Supports multiple disks and custom drivers.

## T

### Temporary Directory
A directory created for testing purposes, typically cleaned up after tests complete.

### Test Case
A PHPUnit test class. The package provides `StorageUnitTestCase` and `StorageIntegrationTestCase` base classes.

## U

### Unit Test
A test that verifies a single component in isolation. Uses mocks and the memory adapter.

### Unique Filename
A generated filename (using hash or UUID) that prevents collisions. Created by the `upload()` method.

### Upload
The operation to store a file from a temporary location and generate a unique filename.

## V

### Visibility
File permission level (public or private). Configurable in local storage.

## W

### Write
See [Put](#put).
